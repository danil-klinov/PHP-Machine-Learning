Fotheringhay My name is Bess Curle, but this is not my story. It is the story of my lady Mary, Queen of Scots. She wrote the story, and then she gave it to me. I am going to give it to her son.

One or two houses, a river, some trees, some horses, and a road. That's all. The road goes to London, the home of Queen Elizabeth of England. Mary sat with her little dog in her hands and watched it, all day long. No one came along the road. Nothing happened. I watched Mary, unhappily. 'Please, Your Majesty, come away from that window,'I said.' It doesn't help. No one is going to come. Queen Elizabeth can't do it - Queens don't kill Queens.' 'Don't they, Bess?' Mary said.
